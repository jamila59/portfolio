          <p> My name is Jamila Aliyeva and I am from Baku,Azerbaijan. Me and my family moved to Seattle, Washington when I was 10 years of age. I am currently 20 years old and I really enjoy living in Seattle because of the beautiful nature that surronds the city. I recently have had a <em> spark </em>of interest in programming due to a Biology Lab class that guided me understanding some basics of coding. Due to this exposere,i decided to seek and join a software developing school to attend.
