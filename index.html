        <h1>Hi I'm Jamila!</h1>
        <p> My name is <span style="color:#786e51"> Jamila Aliyeva </span> and I am from <strong>Baku, Azerbaijan</strong>. Me and my family moved to Seattle, Washington when I was 10 years of age. I am currently 20 years old and I really enjoy living in Seattle because of the beautiful nature that surronds the city. I recently have had a <em> spark </em>of interest in programming due to a Biology Lab class that guided me understanding some basics of coding. Due to this exposere, decided to seek and join a software developing school to attend.</p>

          <h2>Software Development</h2>
          <p>During the first week of Epicodus I have learned how to use HTML,CSS and Bootstrap. The first two link will exibit knowledge of HTML and CSS through an adoption catalog and cupcake shop page. The next two webpages implement bootstap to style the page. The vacation-site webpage will show newly learned bootstrap skills and the wiki-site will implement all three languages in order to resemble a wiki page.</p>
